  <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
  <p><strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong> <br><br> <a href="https://katherinehansen.github.io/Data_Science_Portfolio/CancerPoverty.pdf" target="_blank">Cancer Mortalities and Poverty Rates</a>  - via JMP, R
    <br><em>&emsp;An examination of a possible connection between poverty rates across America and correlated cancer mortality rates. 
                  I discuss the validity of the simple linear regression results, as well as look into any outlier cases, 
                  coming to the conclusion that poverty rates accounted for about 18% of the variability in cancer mortalities 
                  across the United States, based on the sample used.</em>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Multiple Linear Regression</strong> <br><br> <a href="https://katherinehansen.github.io/Data_Science_Portfolio/BirthWeight.pdf" target="_blank">North Carolina Birth Weights</a>  - via JMP, R
    <br><em>&emsp;A regression using multiple variables to predict birth weights of North Carolinian babies, including the mother's 
                  minority status, whether she smokes, how many children she had previously birthed, etc. In combination, these variables 
                  explained about 46% of differences seen in the birth weights of babies. </em>

    <br><em>&emsp;A look into the increased popularity of early and absentee voting for presidential elections in Minnesota, 
                  especially as it pertained to the 2020 election. Marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person voting was 
                  advised against and the option of voting absentee was greatly encouraged. These visualizations include
                  a look over the past 2 decades of elections, a breakdown by county for the 2016 and 2020 elections, and
                  an infographic showing some demographics of early voting.</em>

    <strong>World Bank Indicators and Covid</strong> <br><br> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katherine.hansen/viz/WorldBankIndicatorsandCovid/WorldBankIndicatorsandCOVID" target="_blank">Hosted on Tableau Public</a> - via Tableau, Python, Excel
    <br><em>&emsp;I set out to discover potential relationships between World Bank Development Indicators and COVID-19 cases by country. I pulled data from multiple sources,
                  with most data management carried out using Python. In Tableau, I created graphs for each indicator (such as life expectancy, tobacco use, etc.) with the 
                  countries COVID-19 case rates, as well as an interactive version with which the dates of interest can be manipulated and more.</em>
  </p>
  <h2>Data Managment</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>World Bank Indicators and Covid</strong> <br>  - via Python (Pandas), Excel <br>
    <br><em>&emsp;Beginning with three datasets: COVID-19 cases, country populations, and World Bank indicators, I cleaned and organized them in order to 
                  combine them into a single dataset, then manipulated columns to get COVID-19 rates by country and general formatting work. Since
                  the indicators had data for multiple years, I wanted to filter it down to only the single year of data I wanted for each, then saved
                  it out as a csv file to use later in Tableau to visualize.

    <strong>Sell Short Trades File Clean-up</strong> <br>  - via Python <br><br> Original messy text file
    <iframe src="https://katherinehansen.github.io/Data_Science_Portfolio/Sell Short Trades.txt" title="Text file"></iframe>
    <br><em>&emsp;This task was to take this original messy text file and clean it using Python.
                  First, unwanted lines such as blank lines, page number lines, and repeated headers were removed
                  by matching regex patterns. Next, as data for a single trade was spread across 2-4 lines (as opposed
                  to only a single line), I grouped them together into single lines per trade. Then the next step was 
                  to split up the data into columns, done via regex, and fix some data errors and finally, reorder
                  the columns to match the header.

    <br><em>&emsp;A collection of SQL practices facilitated through Java JDBC, including basic SQL syntax like select, where, etc. as well
                  as <u>stored procedures</u>, <u>prepared statements</u>, and <u>transactions</u>. Projects included table creation and updates/deletes,

    <br><em>&emsp;A small scale database self created to experiment with web programming interaction through
                  PHP and SQL. There is a login page (which uses frontDesk, frontDesk_pw to login for this example)
                  that sends information to a page in the background to verify login details, which, if successful, then takes
                  you to the main page for a pretend front desk employee. There, they can fill out forms to add new customers,
                  schedule appointments with personal trainers, and delete appointments all while updating the tables in 
                  the SQL database.
